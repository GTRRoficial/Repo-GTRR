Até onde eu entendia, um homem que deu errado como eu ainda é um homem. Eu ainda era uma provável ameaça. ‘Self-discipline’ could be demanded of me in ways that could never be reasonably imposed on those readily accepted as women. Se eu não passava de um homem que deu errado com uma voz fodida, um desejo por amor verdadeiro e ambições ainda por cima, o mínimo que eu poderia fazer era reduzir os danos colaterais. Era assim que eu me entendia; em relação a minha abusadora, a minha irmã e a qualquer outra mulher que tivesse estado ao meu lado -- mesmo em admiração. Talvez eu nunca me tornasse uma pessoa totalmente boa, mas eu poderia ao menos tentar não repetir o eco da dominação masculina. Eu poderia resistir  à violência reguladora que definiu o meu passado e que ainda serve de foco para as minhas neuroses.
	O problema é que isso só me confortava temporariamente. Eu ainda me sentia acorrentada. Eu ainda odiava meu corpo e passava noites me interrogando em frente ao espelho do banheiro. Todo o meu automonitoramento em busca de sinais de masculinidade maligna não servia de nada para combater o sofrimento,  não me oferecia oferecia qualquer comunhão com as (outras) mulheres ao meu redor. E ainda que eu conseguisse fazer algum bem e fazer amigos, eu ainda me sentia fragmentada. Quanto mais as pessoas me conheciam, mais se mostrava a minha neurose. Palavras simples me deixavam no limite. Com o passar dos anos, aprendi que eu sou só um eco das expectativas de algum outro e que a minha humanidade depende da minha correspondência a elas. Do brinquedo sexual do gueto, a ser considerada um possível atirador em massa na escola por ser introvertida demais, a ser símbolo em que um  None of that displaced the alienation I felt. Sure, I wasn’t the spitting image of a domestic abuser from a TV crime drama. But I still wasn’t given room to be a whole person. To be whole meant being ‘dangerous’ and barred out of the few ‘safe spaces’ I was permitted to be in.
	So it is with femininity – whether innate or compulsory, a matter of what you call yourself, or the judging gaze of someone else. As I try to be free from heterosexual, masculine expectations, I want to be seen. People had seen me as a strange, awkward boy for over 20 years. And perhaps still do, given their furtive stares and fumbling of my name and pronouns when I’m in the room.
In ‘boy mode’ I had friends and relationships, but I was still expected to live up to the same toxic norms even with people who claimed to be against them as marginalised people themselves. Other times I did wrong and apologised to a neurotic degree, wishing that the disease I apparently had by being assigned male at birth would just melt away. A few people even questioned me on my gender, noticing how much time I spent around trans women online, and reading their literature. But I did not allow myself to be forgiven for living through all of this. After all, if I am really a girl or am really a worthwhile, innocent person, I should not have lived like this. I should not have made mistakes like a man, overshared to a friend and had them tell me how irritating I am to talk to, wore the wrong clothes, said the wrong things, used the wrong tone of voice.
Poor and Black, I had a difficult time feeling like a person, much less a woman.
	To their credit, bell hooks and Alice Walker at least laid out capitalism’s role in racialisation and gendered exploitation. Working through their writing and speeches, I’ve found portions of their struggle to be a lot more nourishing for my contemporary fight. I struggle alongside those who quote them often. Even so, I’m not sure if they would like me. bell hooks in particular has condemned the trans women subjects of Paris is Burning, as if people like us are problematic reifications of gendered oppression. Alice Walker’s anti-Semitism seems to suggest the same reflex of hostility towards minorities, scapegoating us for society’s ills. That these are the attitudes of supposed radical theorists hasn’t helped my sense of isolation.
	As much as people talk about the virtue of marginalised people, to this day I’m caught in waves of shame and fear. There are days where I feel that none of my marginality or struggle justifies me even waking up in the morning, just because of guilt. Sometimes I hate myself for not adhering to the performance of what a woman is supposed to be. I find myself falling short of matching an ever-shifting ideal, whether that’s docile or hypercritical, because of a battle between my survival and what wider society allows.
